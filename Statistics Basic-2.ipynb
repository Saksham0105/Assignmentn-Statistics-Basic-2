    "   - **Mean**: Outliers can pull the mean towards them, especially if they are extreme values. This is because the mean is calculated by summing all the data points and dividing by the total number of data points. Outliers have a disproportionate effect on the sum, thus affecting the mean.\n",
    "   - **Median**: The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean because it represents the middle value when the data is sorted. Outliers do not have a direct impact on the position of the median, as long as they are not close to the middle of the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Mode**: Outliers generally do not affect the mode because it represents the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. However, if an outlier occurs with a significantly higher frequency, it may influence the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Measures of Dispersion**:\n",
    "   - **Range**: Outliers can increase the range of the dataset, especially if they are extreme values. The range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values, and outliers can widen this difference.\n",
    "   - **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation of the dataset. This is because these measures are based on the squared deviations of each data point from the mean. Outliers, especially extreme ones, have large squared deviations, leading to higher variance and standard deviation.\n",
